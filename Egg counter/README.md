<p>Imagine a classroom full of students who love collecting eggs. The first student in the row has 1 egg. The second student is a little greedier and has 2 eggs. The third one is even crazier about eggs and has 4! The pattern continues with each kid having double the number of eggs as the kid before them.</p>
</br></br>
To make it clearer, here's how it starts:

- 1st Student: 1 egg
- 2nd Student: 2 eggs
- 3rd Student: 4 eggs
- 4th Student: 8 eggs
...and so on.
</br>

<p>Now, imagine you are at the end of this line of students. If there are, let's say, 10 students in total, how many eggs does the last student have?</p>
